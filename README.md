*Broadcom* chips are used in approximately a billion of devices, such as
all *iPhones*, *MacBooks*, the *Samsung Galaxy S* series, the older *Google
Nexus* series, older *Thinkpads*, *Raspberry Pis*, various IoT devices, and more.
In 2016, *Cypress* acquired the IoT division of *Broadcom*. Since
then, firmware variants slightly diverged, as *Broadcom* kept non-IoT customers like
*Apple* and *Samsung*. However, the firmware interaction
and update mechanism stayed the same. We reverse-engineered how the operating
systems patch this firmware and interact with it. Based on that we developed a
Bluetooth experimentation framework, which is able to patch the firmware.
This enables various features that otherwise would only be possible with
a full-stack software-defined radio implementation, such as injecting and
monitoring packets on the link layer.

*InternalBlue* has not only been used for our own research at the Secure Mobile
Networking Lab ([SEEMOO](https://seemoo.de)). Also, the [KNOB](https://knobattack.com/) and [BIAS](https://francozappa.github.io/about-bias/) attack prototype 
were implemented using *InternalBlue* LMP messages
and the [SweynTooth](https://asset-group.github.io/disclosures/sweyntooth/) attacks also
experimented with *InternalBlue* for crafting LCP messages. Note that in contrast to tools like
[btlejack](https://github.com/virtualabs/btlejack) or
[Ubertooth](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth), *InternalBlue* does not
aim at performing Machine-in-the-Middle attacks. However, the device running *InternalBlue*
can send arbitrary packets and also inject these into existing connections. During
monitoring, all packets that are received by the device running *InternalBlue* are
captured, and there is no packet loss. *InternalBlue* does not have any issues with analysis of encrypted connections or
Classic Bluetooth. If you have specific feature requests for your security research,
feel free to open a ticket.

In addition to security research, *InternalBlue* also opens possibilities for
further analysis such as Bluetooth Low Energy performance statistics and improvements.
Anything that can be improved within a Bluetooth stack can be directly tested on
off-the-shelf devices.

Our recent research features [Frankenstein](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/frankenstein),
which emulates the firmware including thread switches and virtual modem input. The
emulated firmware can be attached to a *Linux* host. Thus, the approach is full-stack.
We mainly used it for fuzzing and found vulnerabilities that include host responses
to be triggered. *Frankenstein* is in a separate repository, but depends on *InternalBlue*
to take state snapshots etc. on a physical device.

Moreover, we just published [Polypyus](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/polypyus).
It enables binary-only binary diffing, independent from *IDA* and *Ghidra*. However,
it integrates into that workflow by identifying good starting points for further
analysis. We already tried it across various *Broadcom* Wi-Fi and Bluetooth firmware.

Looking for our random number generator measurements that we did within the analysis
of CVE-2020-6616? You can find them [here](doc/rng.md).

Due to Spectra ðŸ‘»ðŸŒˆ the write and read RAM commands are disabled after driver initialization.
Workarounds for this are described in the according *Android* and *iOS* instructions,
bypasses for other devices will follow if needed.
